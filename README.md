Assignment: Create a basic recipe website that consists of a main index page with links to a few recipes.

Reflection: Utilized the html boilerplate, headers, unordered and ordered lists, links, and images. 

Tips and Tricks learned: You can create multiple list elements by doing "ul>li*number of elements" or substitute "ul" with "ol" depending on if it's ordered then pressing enter. You can get an image source off the web by using "copy image address" on a website's image.
